# My Portfolio

These are the files I use to create my portfolio website at mikemccloskey.tech. I recently updated it because my web host didn't provide a means of saving contact information.

I did have the option of creating my own database and connecting the form myself, but it required the use both PHP and MySQL, which I did not know. So I spent a day teaching myself enough of both languages to get the job done, and now my contact form is working as it should.
